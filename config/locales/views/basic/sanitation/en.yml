        recurrent_expenditure:
          question: How much is being spent/will be spent to operate, maintain and support the delivery of sanitation services (per person per year)?
          info: "Operating and minor maintenance expenditure: typically comprises regular expenditure such as labour, fuel, chemicals, materials, and purchases of any bulk water. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Operational_and_Minor_Maintenance_Expenditure_(OpEx) Capital maintenance expenditure: Asset renewal and replacement cost: occasional and ‘lumpy’ costs that seek to restore the functionality of a system, such as replacing pump rods or foot valves in handpumps, or a diesel generator in motorised systems. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Capital_Maintenance_Expenditure_(CapManEx) Expediture of direct support: Direct support is structured support to service providers and users or user groups related to the operation and management of a WASH service; direct support costs are the costs of such support. They cover monitoring, technical advice and administrative, organisational or legal support.  The costs of support before and during the capital construction of a project are not included; they are considered to be capital software. Direct support is often used synonymously with “post-construction support”. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Direct_Support_(ExpDS) Expenditure of indirect support: Indirect support costs cover expenditure on this macro-level support, including planning and policy making, and support to decentralised service authorities or local government. Indirect support includes capacity building for professionals and technicians and capacity support to local government as service authorities, for example to adhere to national norms, standards and guidelines. See: http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Expenditure_Indirect_Support_(ExpIDS)"

          a111: "There is a high incidence of open defecation as latrines are not being used. Additionally, if there are latrines, these are not being cleaned or emptied. Barely any money is being spent on recurrent annual expenditure  and as a result the service has failed and live may be at risk!"
          a113: "Although existing latrines are reasonably clean, there is a high incidence of open defecation as latrines are not being used. Barely any money is being spent on recurrent annual expenditure, specifically on maintaining or improving behaviour change for latrine use. Lives may be at risk!"

          b111: "These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces and it is causing significant environmental pollution, live may be at risk!
