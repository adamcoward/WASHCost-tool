        summaries:
          a111: "There is a high incidence of open defecation as latrines are not being used. Additionally, if there are latrines, these are not being cleaned or emptied. Barely any money is being spent on recurrent annual expenditure  and as a result the service has failed and live may be at risk!"
          a113: "Although existing latrines are reasonably clean, there is a high incidence of open defecation as latrines are not being used. Barely any money is being spent on recurrent annual expenditure, specifically on maintaining or improving behaviour change for latrine use. Lives may be at risk!"
          a114: "Although existing latrines are routinely cleaned, there is a high incidence of open defecation as latrines are not being used. Barely any money is being spent on recurrent annual expenditure, specifically on maintaining or improving behaviour change for latrine use. Lives may be at risk!"
          a131: "The facilities are being used by some household members. However, latrines are not being cleaned or emptied and may pose a health risk.  Barely any money is being spent on recurrent annual expenditure  to ensure basic maintenance of the latrine."
          a133: "Existing latrines are reasonably clean and facilities are being used by some household members. The total recurrent annual expenditure is lower than WASHCost benchmarks there might be context specific reasons for this but consider validating the data inputted. "
          a134: "Existing latrines are routinely cleaned and emptied. Facilities are being used by some household members. The total recurrent annual expenditure is lower than WASHCost benchmarks there might be context specific reasons for this but consider validating the data inputted. "

          a211: "There is a high incidence of open defecation as latrines are not being used. Additionally, if there are latrines, these are not being cleaned or emptied.  Recurrent annual expenditure is within WASHCost benchmarks so factors other than recurrent costs are influencing the service. Another possibility is that the context requires more recurrent expenditure to promote latrine use and maintenance."

Recurrent annual expenditure is higher than WASHCost benchmarks so factors other than recurrent costs are influencing the service.  There are two possibilities, the context is exceptional and requires specific measure to address latrine use and maintenance and/or factors other than costs are having a significant impact on service delivery."

          a333: "Existing latrines are reasonably clean and facilities are being used by some household members. Recurrent annual expenditure is higher than WASHCost benchmarks. The context may require high levels of mobilisation for latrine use and maintenance or the service could be run more efficiently."
          a334: "Existing latrines are routinely cleaned and emptied. Facilities are being used by some household members. Recurrent annual expenditure is higher than WASHCost benchmarks perhaps resulting in higher levels of service. Alternatively the context may require high levels of mobilisation for latrine use and maintenance or the service could be run more efficiently."

          b111: "These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces and it is causing significant environmental pollution, live may be at risk! This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure, which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery."
          b113: These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces. However due to context, there is no problematic environmental impact, and therefore faeces are disposed of safely. This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure, which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery.
          b114: These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces. However due to context, there is no problematic environmental impact, and faeces are being re-used safely. This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure, which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery.
          b131: These facilities have a cement or impermeable slab providing adequate separation between users and faeces, however it is causing significant environmental pollution and lives may be at risk! This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure  which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery.
          b133: The capital expenditure entered is lower than WASHCost benchmarks yet these facilities have a cement or impermeable slab providing adequate separation between users and faeces and there is no problematic environmental impact. Are there any reasons for this?
          b134: The capital expenditure entered is lower than WASHCost benchmarks yet these facilities have a cement or impermeable slab providing adequate separation between users and faeces. The by-products from the facilities are also being re-used safely. Are there any reasons for this?

          b211: These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces and it is causing significant environmental pollution, live may be at risk! Capital expenditure is within WASHCost benchmarks, factors other than costs are influencing service delivery or the context requires more expensive infrastructure.

The context may be exceptional and requires more expensive infrastructure or cost efficiency can be improved.
          b334: The capital expenditure entered is higher than WASHCost benchmarks and these facilities have a cement or impermeable slab providing adequate separation between users and faeces. The by-products from the facilities are also being re-used safely. A higher level of service is being achieved or the context may be exceptional and requires more expensive infrastructure. Another possibility is that cost efficiency can be improved.

          b344: The capital expenditure entered is within WASHCost benchmarks and these facilities have a cement or impermeable slab providing adequate separation between users and faeces within the compound. The by-products from the facilities are also being re-used safely. A very good level of service is being achieved or the context may be exceptional and requires more expensive infrastructure. Another possibility is that cost efficiency can be improved.
