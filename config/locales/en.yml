      b111:	"These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces and it is causing significant environmental pollution, live may be at risk! This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure, which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery."
      b113:	These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces. However due to context, there is no problematic environmental impact, and therefore faeces are disposed of safely. This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure, which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery.
      b114:	These facilities do not provide adequate separation between users and faeces. However due to context, there is no problematic environmental impact, and faeces are being re-used safely. This may be due to insufficient capital expenditure, which is well below WASHCost benchmarks or other factors other than costs are influencing service delivery.
      b131:	These facilities have a cement or impermeable slab providing adequate separation between users and faeces, however it is causing significant environmental pollution and lives may be at risk!
